Hey there! Welcome to the FearlessStudios-FiveMTemplate. This is your go-to setup for crafting Lua resources tailored for FiveM.

## Setup
This script now requires FS-Lib found here
https://github.com/FearlessNite345/FS-Lib/releases/latest

## Postal Setup

Setting up the postal system is easy:

1. **Grab a Postal File**:
   - Check out the `postals` folder for all available postal JSON files.

2. **Customize (Optional)**:
   - Want your own postal setup? No problem!
   - Drop your custom postal JSON file into the `config` folder.

Just make sure whatever file you're using is named `"postals.json"`. With that, you're all set to go!
